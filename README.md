# Three-Layer-NN-PyTorch
In this project I implemented a fully connected three layer neural network using pytorch, and trained it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The tar file needs to be downloaded into the root folder from: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html. If gpu is available, the training is performed on gpu thanks to cuda being supported by pytorch.
